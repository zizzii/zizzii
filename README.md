### Computer Engineering Student @ Politecnico di Milano

I am a second-year undergraduate student currently building my foundational knowledge in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic interests lie at the intersection of low-level software systems and Artificial Intelligence architecture.

I am particularly driven by independent study to understand the mathematical and architectural underpinnings of modern deep learning systems, moving beyond high-level APIs to understand the mechanisms of computation.

## Current Research & Focus

* **Large Language Models:** Working on a pedagogical implementation of a GPT-style model to dissect the mechanics of Transformers, specifically Self-Attention and Pre-training pipelines.
* **Computer Systems:** Strengthening my grasp of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Memory Management to write efficient, hardware-aware code.
* **IoT & Mobile Architecture:** Developing the *BEA Band App* (Polimi Data Scientist Association). Focusing on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocols, real-time binary data parsing, and local persistence optimization.
