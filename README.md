### Computer Engineering Student @ Politecnico di Milano

I am a second-year undergraduate student currently building my foundational knowledge in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic interests lie at the intersection of low-level software systems and Artificial Intelligence architecture.

I am particularly driven by independent study to understand the mathematical and architectural underpinnings of modern deep learning systems, moving beyond high-level APIs to understand the mechanisms of computation.
